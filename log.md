### Day 01: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 "Lexical Scope" 50 minute, code 45 minute create my grid base on BEM and SCSS <br>
**Thoughts:** Learn a new concept about "Lexical Scope", one more "brick" :), I am building my own walk. Scss is cool but some time it difficult, because some time it take me a amount of time to debug. And I think I almost done my first grid :D, hura!

### Day 02: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 3 "Function vs. Block Scope" 45 minute. 15 minute research Foundation  <br>
**Thoughts:** In this chapter I recognize my knowlegde about function expression, and little understand about
library "Why theme wrap code with function expression or just out put and Object". And about Foundation, I watch getting started at 12h00, and that voice like he didn't sleep for a weak. I think Foundation will be cool, with another way resolve problem.
