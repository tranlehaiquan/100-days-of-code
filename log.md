**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 "Lexical Scope" 50 minute, code 45 minute create my grid base on BEM and SCSS <br>
**Thoughts:** Learn a new concept about "Lexical Scope", one more "brick" :), I am building my own walk. Scss is cool but some time it difficult, because some time it take me a amount of time to debug. And I think I almost done my first grid :D, hura!
