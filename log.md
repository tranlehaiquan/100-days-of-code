### Day 0: June 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I getting started recognize my knowledge about Javascript thought the book, "You don't know Js". Start with Scope & Closures.<br>
And completed little auto choose food.  <br>
**Thoughts:** When I began, it was hard. Because I usually read book with fully images and quiz to explain me about concept...
But when I finished first chapter. I changed my mind about this book, it give me total insight about javasciprt, dig deep.
So calmn and learn Js :) <br>

### Day 01: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 "Lexical Scope" 50 minute, code 45 minute create my grid base on BEM and SCSS <br>
**Thoughts:** Learn a new concept about "Lexical Scope", one more "brick" :), I am building my own walk. Scss is cool but some time it difficult, because some time it take me a amount of time to debug. And I think I almost done my first grid :D, hura!

### Day 02: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 3 "Function vs. Block Scope" 45 minute. 15 minute research Foundation  <br>
**Thoughts:** In this chapter I recognize my knowlegde about function expression, and little understand about
library "Why theme wrap code with function expression or just out put and Object". And about Foundation, I watch getting started at 12h00, and that voice like he didn't sleep for a weak. I think Foundation will be cool, with another way resolve problem.

### Day 03: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue read chapter 3 for 15 minute. First time use Foundation grid <br>
**Thoughts:** This is the first time I am use Foundation to make a simple page, the different bettewn bootstrap and Foundation is Foundation use 3 breakpoint (large, medium, small) row also is container.
Have two grid mode, is float and flex. When I use float make two columns with not equal 12 columns size I realize that the last column will float right, not left!
Also have push, pull, offset. I think it will hard to responsive because Foundation have only 3 bearkpoint (without custom).
